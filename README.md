# Final Project Transforming and Analyzing Data with SQL

## Project/Goals
- The Transforming and Analyzing Data with SQL Project is a great introduction to the SQL world.
- We've been challenged with handling an unknown set of files representing some online activities.
- The goal is to process the data on files to create a working database and fit the data into it.



## Process
### Extract the data from CSV files.
### Transform - try to make sense out of the data and organize it.
### Load - move the content of the files to the well-structured environment - a database.

## Results
[//]: # (&#40;fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions&#41;)
- At the first glance on the data I realized that there is no much info compared to the amount of the data supplied.
- There have been multiple columns with NULL or default entries.
- Content of the largest file in the set contains duplicated records exceeding 50% of the file.

## Challenges
[//]: # (&#40;discuss challenges you faced in the project&#41;)
- The same data is scattered into 2 or more files.
- Some data entries misled (i.e.) integer looking like piece of data is too big for any integer type field. 
- It's been very difficult to refer to any tables for a piece of information because the same pieces are used in various places for unknown reasons.

## Future Goals
[//]: # (&#40;what would you do if you had more time?&#41;)
Having spent limited time on, extracting, transforming, loading and analyzing the data quality, I was able to get some feedbacks.
With every new attempt on getting information out of the data, we realize what should be done differently and in what order the events would happen.
For the upcoming task we will apply the knowledge and experiences gained from handling the project's requirements. 
We should look into the future with optimism and believe that next time we will do it better.
